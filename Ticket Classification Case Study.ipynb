       "11    On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n",

by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally thank you   \n",

immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on  notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on  this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report

they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have  in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points when i called back to ask if they

xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday  about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday  i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday  then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within     days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account

                            on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guidelines they dont refund more then  overdrawft doesnt matter bank fault or not\\n\\ntaken  from people is money just because you can is not ok\\n\\nsee attached documents when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place   \n",

they show that on the xxxx of   I be very late on my bill and owe xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finish with the bill I pay that amount on the same day the xxxx to be it to xxxx \\n\\n they say that I try to make another payment for   later that same day and in a few day that come back as a return payment \\n\\n the man on the phone state to I that if the payment go through then it would have mean that I have a credit on my account for xxxx since I do nt owe anything \\n\\n they update my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that I have no idea of since I think I pay off the entire amount they report to the credit bureau that I be   day late for not pay what accrue to be   the guy represent chase agree with I that they be in the wrong for charge I the fee and say they would remove they I still have   in the negative that they be say that I owe in the mobile app \\n\\n additionally because they report I be late my credit score drop   point when I call back to ask if they can report that they make a mistake they say I would have to do that on my own I think that s xxxx   \n",

  on xxxx   I make a   payment to an online retailer use chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website I realize that this be a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regard the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt get a refund through the retailer bank \\n\\n I contact chase via a secure message on   explain what happen and ask   be there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give I more information about the recipient   that xxxx my message be review and I receive a response restate my original email and inform I that   the transfer have be complete however as you mention that the website be a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you well in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team   I call the number list in the email and explain my situation to then be transfer to the claim department I be direct to call xxxx and ask they about the transaction because chase do not have any information outside of what I provide when initiate the transfer I feel like this agent be try to get I to end the call as quickly as possible and I have to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and do not have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase I should use to get the information I be look for \\n\\n I call xxxx who s automate system initially direct I to call my bank because I use the bank app to initiate the transaction I call xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they tell I that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because I use the bank app to perform the transaction she stay on the line with I until I understand everything that I should ask and have a well understanding of the situation I end the call and call chase again \\n\\n when I call chase the second time the agent try to look up the information about the receive bank but could not find any additional information she then ask I why I need this information and I explain my situation again I be once again transfer to the claim department who tell I that I need to contact xxxx to get the information I be look for after I tell she that I have already contact they she finally admit that there be nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction be not secure she say that chase have no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputte and that the recipient banking information be not keep in the system in both phone call they ask if I initiate that transaction and use that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter \\n\\n during this whole process it feel like chase be not transparent about their policy regard these type of transaction nor be they helpful in help I get any information about the situation these transaction be advertise as a   fast safe and easy way to send money   but seem to be a dangerous way to do business I feel deceive by chase s advertising and far victimize by the way I be treat by the member on their customer service team   \n",
